## Title:

Ketogenic Tracker

## Description:

Ketogenic Tracker will first describe what ketogenic diet is and its benefits. Then, it will calculate how much calories users should consume when they are on a ketogenic diet by asking their height, weight, age, and activity level. I will write functions in JavaScript to calculate a person's BMR and to determine total calorie needs(by multiplying BMR by the appropriate activity factor). And I would convert calories into grams of fats, protein, and carbs.

Next, it will print line graphs that show a recommended and personalized total number of calories they should consume and how much protein, fats, and carbohydrates they need to consume.

Finally, it will ask users to input the name of the food they had or will have to get its nutrition data and these data will be added up on the right side and will be compared to the recommendation we’ve gotten earlier. If the sum meets the recommended calories and macros of a ketogenic diet, the result will print "your diet is recommended for a ketogenic diet" in a green color font. If not, it will print "your diet is not recommended for a ketogenic diet" in a red color font.

Formula:
They will look the same for all 3 devices.

## API: Nutritionix:

World’s largest verified nutrition database - https://developer.nutritionix.com/

## MVP:

I will try to mimic the wireframe using CSS and HTML and I will have to use JavaScript to write a function that calculates the recommended daily calories for a ketogenic diet. I also have to create line graphs using CSS and JavaScript. I also have to make sure my API does not have any limits so that I won’t have any problem in the future. I would have to use flexbox to make two aligned boxes to see the nutrition data of food the users typed in and the sum of all the food nutrition data on the right side. I will also make sure to create the same design for 3 screen sizes including desktop and 2 media queries(tablet and mobile).

## Post-MVP:

Once my MVP is complete, it would be nice to ask for advice from UI/UX designers so that users could easily utilize my app.
