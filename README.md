## Title:

Low Carbohydrate Diet Nutrients

## Description:

Low Carbohydrate Diet Nutrients will first describe what low-carb diet is and its benefits. I will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts to make three boxes that will display a food nutrition data that user inputs, all 5 individual food nutrition data, and finally a total/sum of 5 food nutrition data.

If the total/sum meets the recommended macros of a low-carb diet, the result will print "your diet is recommended for a low-carb diet". If not, it will print "your diet is not recommended for a low-carb diet."

## Wireframe:

They will look the same for all 3 devices. (MacBook Air, iPhone X, and iPad Pro)

## API: Nutritionix:

Worldâ€™s largest verified nutrition database - https://developer.nutritionix.com/

## MVP:

I will try to mimic the wireframe using CSS and HTML and I will have to use JavaScript to write a function to display nutrition data. I also have to make sure my API does not hit the limits fast. I would have to use flexbox to make three aligned boxes. I will also make sure to create the same design for 3 screen sizes including desktop and 2 media queries(tablet and mobile).

## Post-MVP:

Once my MVP is complete, it would be nice to ask for advice from UI/UX designers so that users could easily utilize my app.
